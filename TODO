Things I would like to do
-------------------------

1) Unit tests ... I started writing a framework, and now this seems like
the next Most Important Thing

2) Is the configure script a little broken?

3) I want to do a Fourier Space static potential computation for alpha_s.
I think I have greater than half of the prerequisites for this...
